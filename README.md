# Shadow Casting
This repository is just a Rust translation of the shadow casting algorithm from
the Python implementation shown [here](https://www.albertford.com/shadowcasting/).
It is a very nice article, with visuals and explaination.


This implementation is tested against the examples in the article, and seems to 
produce identical results.
